# My First Week of jQuery

I followed the 5-part video series ["jQuery Crash Course"](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbYJVXBgZ_nA7FTAAEpp_IAc) by Traversy Media on YouTube to learn the basics of jQuery. Although this is a good series to watch, I would say it is a little outdated because it was recorded back in 2016 so none of the ES6 and above functionality is mentioned. I did, however, tweak my code to include some newer functionality.

##### The contents are explained as follows:
1. The folder titled "1. Selectors" corresponds to part 1 of the aforementioned video series.
2. The folder titled "2. Events" corresponds to part 2 of the video series.
3. The folder titled "3. DOM Manipulation" corresponds to part 3 of the video series.
4. The folder titled "4. Effects and Animations" corresponds to part 4 of the video series.
5. The folder titled "5. Ajax" corresponds to part 5 of the video series.
6. The folder titled "Quiz App" is the final small project I made to test my knowledge and have some fun. I did not follow a tutorial for it so can't link you to a video, but you've got all my code so...

##### Notes:
 - He (the guy doing the tutorial videos) tends to comment out or delete his code as he goes through the video. I don't like that method because then I can't compare the various methods and functions. For that reason I have a lot more code/content on my pages than he does.
 - I found the gifs on Google and do not own the rights to them.
 - If you are looking through my code and see areas where I can improve, feel free to let me know.
